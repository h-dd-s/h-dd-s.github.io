## The Data

<p>From the AAMC website, I took a data table titled "U.S. MD-Granting Medical School Applications and Matriculants by School, State of Legal Residence, and Gender, Academic Year 2024-2025"</p>

<img src="Untidy Data.png" alt="Data from AAMC"/>

## The Approach to Creating the Simulation

1.  From matriculants and applications calculate acceptance rate for each school

2.  Create a function in which an "applicant" selects twenty random schools

3.  Repeat the function 500 times

4.  Graph the number of applicants vs the number of schools accepted

## Tidying The Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openxlsx)

# open up the data and calculate acceptance rates
medschool <- read.xlsx("mdsimdata.xlsx", sheet = "Usable") |>
  mutate(acceptrate = matriculants/applicants)

northeast <-("CT|DC|MA|MD|NH|NJ|NY|PA|RI|VT")
south <- ("AL|AR|FL|GA|KY|KS|LA|NC|NE|OK|SC|TN|TX|VA|WV")
west <- ("AZ|CA|CO|HI|NM|NV|OR|UT|WA|WY")
midwest <- ("IA|IL|IN|MI|MO|MN|ND|OH|SD|WI")

reg_medschool <- medschool |>
  mutate(state = str_sub(state, 1,2)) |>
  mutate(region = ifelse(str_detect(state, midwest) , "Midwest",
           ifelse(str_detect(state, south), "South", 
                  ifelse(str_detect(state, west) , "West", "Northeast"
             ))))
```

## The Original Function

```{r}
accepted <- function(numschools){
  medschool |>
    sample_n(numschools) |>
    mutate(qual = runif(numschools)) |>
    mutate(gotin = ifelse(qual < acceptrate, 1, 0)) |>
    summarize(numaccept = sum(gotin))
}
```

## Results

```{r}
trials <- rep(c(20), 500)

sim <- map_df(trials, accepted)|>
  rbind()

ggplot(sim) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = numaccept)) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of Schools Accepted",
    y = "Number of Applicants",
    title = "Amount of Medical Schools Accepted Into When Applying to 20 Schools"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

## The Updated Function

```{r}
accepted <- function(numschools){
  gen_qual = runif(1)
  medschool |>
    sample_n(numschools) |>
    mutate(qual = rnorm(numschools, mean = gen_qual, sd = 0.1)) |>
    mutate(gotin = ifelse(qual < acceptrate, 1, 0)) |>
    summarize(numaccept = sum(gotin))
}
```

## Results

```{r}
trials <- rep(c(20), 500)

sim <- map_df(trials, accepted)|>
  rbind() 

ggplot(sim) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = numaccept)) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of Schools Accepted",
    y = "Number of Applicants",
    title = "Amount of Medical Schools Accepted Into When Applying to 20 Schools"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

## Future Directions

-   Seeing how gender might affect the simulation

-   Introducing In-State Bias
