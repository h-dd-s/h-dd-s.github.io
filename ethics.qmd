<h1>Target and Pregnancy Predictions</h1>

A 2012 *New York Times* article recounts how Target developed a pregnancy prediction algorithm. Andrew Pole, a statistician who joined the company in 2002, was approached by marketing colleagues with a provocative question: Could he predict if a customer was pregnant---even if she hadn\'t disclosed it? Retailers consider new parents a \"holy grail\" because major life changes, like having a child, can disrupt established shopping habits. Target wanted to use this opportunity to attract new customers or alter the habits of infrequent shoppers.

To do this, Pole and his team developed an algorithm capable of identifying pregnant customers based on changes in their shopping behavior. Reportedly, it could even estimate a woman\'s due date. The model relied on tracking 25 specific products---such as unscented lotion, large handbags that could double as diaper bags, and zinc or magnesium supplements---to generate a \"pregnancy score.\"

A 2020 *Medium* article revisits and critiques the *New York Times* story, suggesting the original piece may have overstated the algorithm's sophistication. It questions the famous anecdote about a father learning of his daughter's pregnancy via Target ads, arguing that such a coincidence is unlikely and lacks evidence. Even if the story were true, the *Medium* article points out, it says little about the algorithm\'s actual accuracy. The piece uses the original article as an example of poor reporting on algorithms, advocating instead for transparency around metrics like accuracy, false positives/negatives, precision, and recall.

However, both articles overlook a critical ethical issue: consent. In the *Times* article, Target marketers openly state their desire to know if a customer is pregnant---even if she doesn\'t want them to know. While Target may have disclosed general data tracking through cookie notices or loyalty program terms, customers were likely unaware that their purchase history could be used to infer pregnancy status. This level of data inference exceeds what most people expect companies to do with their personal information.

One important safeguard is that this data was not made public. Target assigns unique customer IDs, and if this data were leaked or shared, it could potentially be exploited by other companies or used to expose sensitive personal details.

The individuals tracked were Target shoppers, the intended users of the algorithm, but there\'s no evidence that they were informed or gave consent for their data to be used in this way. If the data had been publicly released, it would be unethical to analyze it for this purpose, as the participants were not willing contributors to the development of this algorithm.

The algorithm was trained by identifying patterns in the shopping habits of customers who had signed up for Target\'s baby registry. For example, Pole discovered that expectant mothers often bought unscented lotion early in their pregnancy. Another analyst noticed purchases of zinc and magnesium supplements within the first 20 weeks. Yet these insights were derived without the informed consent of those customers. A more ethical approach could have involved voluntary surveys asking pregnant customers what products they used most. These responses could then have been matched with broader purchasing data---ensuring that participants knowingly contributed to the research.
